# Master Playlist

Master Playlist is a Web application that uses the [Music Corgis dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/music/) to
create and manage song playlists. Users will be greeted with a home screen showcasing an example playlist. Once logged
in they will be able to create a new playlist. Once the playlist is created, users will be able to search songs that
they would like to add on their playlist. They can add and remove songs, and also view song information, list duration,
artist info and more. Scale wise the MVP is getting the Corgi dataset working properly. From there weâ€™d like to expand
into using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/),
[Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide), and other music sharing websites.
