# Project Title

**Master Playlist**

# Description

Master Playlist is a Web and Mobile application that uses the [Music Corgis dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/music/) to create and manage music playlists and favorite songs. Users will be greeted with a home screen prompting them to log in if they haven't already. Once logged in they will be able to create a new playlist. Once the playlist is created, users will be able to search songs that they would like to add on their playlist. They can add and remove songs, and also view song information, list duration, artist info and more. Scale wise the MVP is getting the Corgi dataset working properly. From there weâ€™d like to expand into using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/), [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide), and other music sharing websites.
